## Some stuff about integration by parts.

Recall the product rule for differentiation which says that if $u$ and $v$ are differentiable functions of $x$ then 
\begin{equation*}
    (uv)'
    = 
    uv' + vu',  
\end{equation*}
where the notation $u'$ is used for derivative of $u$ with respect to $x$. Integration of both sides of this equation with respect to $\mathrm d x$ and in view of the fact that the differentials of $u$ and $v$ are 
\begin{equation*}
    \mathrm d u  = u' \; \mathrm d x
    \qquad\text{ and } \qquad
    \mathrm d v  = v' \; \mathrm d x
\end{equation*}
respectively, we obtain 
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
    uv
    & = \int (uv)'\; \mathrm d x\\
    & = \int u\;  v' \mathrm d x  + \int v\; u'\mathrm d x\\
    & = \int u\; \mathrm d v + \int v \; \mathrm d u
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
Upon rearranging we obtain 
\begin{equation*}
    \int u \; \mathrm d v
    =
    uv - \int v\; \mathrm d u
\end{equation*}
