<p>In this note I will overview the derivation of the formula for computing the area of a region bounded the graphs of two continuous functions; it comes from a simple Riemann sum argument. I will then discuss the most basic application of the theorem. Finally, I will discuss three potential obstacles to application of the theorem and how to overcome each. The computations are kept simple in order to make the main ideas as transparent as possible. In practice, a second-semester calculus student would be expected to apply these ideas in a more nuanced setting that is discussed here.</p>

<h2>The theorem and basic application</h2>

<div class="theorem">
<span id="thm:area" class="theorem"><strong>Theorem 1  </strong></span>If <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> are continuous functions on the inverval <span class="math inline">\([a, b]\)</span> and if <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\geq g(x)\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(x\in [a,b]\)</span> then the area <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> of the region bounded by the graphs of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> and the vertical lines <span class="math inline">\(x = a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x= b\)</span> is
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
    A = \int_a^b(f(x) - g(x))\; \mathrm d x. 
\end{equation*}\]</span>
</div>

<p>As far as applications of this theorem, there are a few techniques that one must be aware of. Let’s start with the most basic example.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:area1" class="example"><strong>Example 1  </strong></span>Compute the area of the region bounded by the graphs of <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = 3 - x^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g(x) = x^2 - 5\)</span> and the vertical lines <span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Solution.</em> Both of the given functions are polynomials and are therefore continuous for all <span class="math inline">\(x\in \mathbb R\)</span>. In particular, they are continuous for all <span class="math inline">\(x\in [0, 1]\)</span>. Thus, once we figure out which of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> (if any) is larger on the interval <span class="math inline">\([0, 1]\)</span>, we can apply Theorem <a href="#thm:area">1</a> to recover the desired area.</p>
<p>Since the graphs of both of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> can be sketched using precalculus-level techniques<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, we can determine which of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> (if any) is larger over the interval <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> by sketching their graphs. The graph of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a parabola that opens downward with vertex at <span class="math inline">\((0, 3)\)</span> and the graph of <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is a parabola that opens upward with vertex at <span class="math inline">\((0, -5)\)</span>. In particular, the inequality <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\geq g(x)\)</span> is satsified for all <span class="math inline">\(x\in [0, 1]\)</span>, see the following figure:</p>

The inequality <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \geq g(x)\)</span> holds for all <span class="math inline">\(x\in [0, 1]\)</span>.

</figure>
Now that all of the relevant hypotheses have been verified, we can recover the area <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> by applying Theorem <a href="#thm:area">1</a> and then carrying out the simplifying computations as follows:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
    A 
    &amp; = \int_0^1(3 - x^2 - (x^2 - 5))\; \mathrm d x\\
    &amp; = \int_0^1(- 2x^2 + 8)\; \mathrm d x\\
    &amp; = -2\int_0^1 x^2 \; \mathrm d x + 8\int_0^1\; \mathrm d x\\
    &amp; = - \frac{2x^3}{3}\bigg|_0^1 + 8 x\bigg|_0^1\\
    &amp; = -\frac 23(1^3 - 0^3) + 8(1 - 0)\\
    &amp; = \frac{22}{3}. 
\end{split}
\end{equation*}\]</span>

<div id="determining-the-integration-bounds" class="section level2">
<h2>Determining the integration bounds</h2>
<p>In Example <a href="#exm:area1">1</a>, the interval over which the integration was to take place was given. In some cases, we may need to determine, based on the wording of the problem and an elementary computation, what the bounds of integration should be.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unnamed-chunk-1" class="example"><strong>Example 2  </strong></span>Compute the area of the region in the right half of the <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span>-plane that is bounded by the graphs of <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = 3 - x^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g(x) = x^2 - 5\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Solution.</em> As in Example <a href="#exm:area1">1</a>, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> are polynomials and are therefore continuous for all <span class="math inline">\(x\in \mathbb R\)</span>. In particular, once we determine the interval over which we want to apply Theorem <a href="#thm:area">1</a>, we are guaranteed that both of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> will be continuous over that interval. The phrase “right half of the <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span>-plane” provided in the problem statement indicates that the interval will be some subinterval of <span class="math inline">\([0,\infty)\)</span>. Since the graphs of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> are obtainable via precalculus-level techniques, we can determine the desired subinterval by making a sketch. The graphs of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> can be obtained as described in Example <a href="#exm:area1">1</a>, and doing so yields the following figure, where the region whose area we wish to compute has also been indicated:</p>

<figcaption>
The interval over which we wish to apply Theorem <a href="#thm:area">1</a> is <span class="math inline">\([0, b]\)</span>. We will need to do a short computation to determine the value of <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The figure indicates that we will need to apply Theorem <a href="#thm:area">1</a> over the interval <span class="math inline">\([0, b]\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-coordinate of the intersection of the graphs of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>. In particular, the value of <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> can be determined by selecting the positive solution to the equation <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = g(x)\)</span> as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
    f(x) = g(x) 
    &amp; \Leftrightarrow 3 - x^2 = x^2 - 5\\
    &amp; \Leftrightarrow 0 = 2x^2 - 8\\
    &amp; \Leftrightarrow 0 = 2(x - 2)(x + 2)\\
    &amp; \Leftrightarrow x\in \{-2, 2\}.
\end{split}
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
Evidently <span class="math inline">\(b = 2\)</span> is the solution we seek. Arguing as in Example <a href="#exm:area1">1</a> we find that <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \geq g(x)\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(x\in [0, 2]\)</span>. Now that all hypotheses of Theorem <a href="#thm:area">1</a> have been verified, we obtain the area <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> of the region described in the problem statement by applying said theorem and performing elementary computations as follows:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
    A 
    &amp; = \int_0^2( 3 - x^2 - (x^2 - 5))\; \mathrm d x\\
    &amp; = -2\int_0^2x^2\;\mathrm d x + 8\int_0^2 \;\mathrm d x\\
    &amp; = -\frac 23(2^3 - 0^3) + 8(2 - 0)\\
    &amp; = \frac{32}{3}. 
\end{split}
\end{equation*}\]</span>

<div id="the-inequlity-fxgeq-gx-does-not-apply-over-the-entire-interval" class="section level2">
<h2>The inequlity <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\geq g(x)\)</span> does not apply over the entire interval</h2>
<p>In some instances, the inequality <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\geq g(x)\)</span> simply does not hold for all <span class="math inline">\(x\in [a,b]\)</span>, no matter how we label <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unnamed-chunk-2" class="example"><strong>Example 3  </strong></span>Compute the area of the region that lies between the graphs of <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = 3 - x^3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g(x) = x^2 - 5\)</span> and between the vertical lines <span class="math inline">\(x= 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x= 3\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Solution.</em>
In this case, the interval under consideration is <span class="math inline">\([0, 3]\)</span>, and neither of the inequalities <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\geq g(x)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\geq f(x)\)</span> hold <em>for all</em> <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in this interval. In particular the one of these two inequalities that holds depends on the value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. The following figure illustrates the situation:</p>

Indeed, if <span class="math inline">\(x\in [0, 2]\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\geq g(x)\)</span>, but if <span class="math inline">\(x\in [2, 3]\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\geq f(x)\)</span>.
</figcaption>
</figure>
To overcome this obstacle, we split the interval <span class="math inline">\([0,3]\)</span> into two subintervals <span class="math inline">\([0, 2]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\([2, 3]\)</span>. These particular subintervals are chosen because on each of these subintervals, we can identify which function (among <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>) is larger and which function is smaller over the entire subinterval. Due to the additivity of the definite integral<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. We may recover the area <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> of the region described in the problem statement by applying Theorem <a href="#thm:area">1</a> separately over the intervals <span class="math inline">\([0, 2]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\([2,3]\)</span> and then adding the results. In symbols:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}

<div id="one-of-the-bounding-curves-changes" class="section level2">
<h2>One of the bounding curves changes</h2>
<p>When it applies, the basic content of Theorem <a href="#thm:area">1</a> is to subtract the smaller function from the larger function and then integrate over the interval of interest. In some cases the larger function or the smaller function (or both) may depend on <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. In these cases the basic strategy is to split the interval under consideration into subintervals where, one each subinterval, there is exactly one larger function and exactly one smaller function. We apply Theorem <a href="#thm:area">1</a> over each subinterval and then sum the results.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unnamed-chunk-3" class="example"><strong>Example 4  </strong></span>Compute the area of the region in the <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span>-plane that is bounded by the the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis and the graphs of the functions <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = 3 - x^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g(x) = x^2 - 5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h(x) = x + 1\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Solution.</em> It is useful to make a quick sketch of the given curves and shade in the region whose area we want to compute. Note that there are two bounded regions in the <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span>-plane whose boundary intersects the graphs of all three of the given functions, but only one of these regions has the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis as part of its boundary.</p>

<figcaption>
If <span class="math inline">\(x\in [0, x_0]\)</span> then the graph of <span class="math inline">\(h(x)\)</span> is the upper bounding curve, but if <span class="math inline">\(x\in [x_0, 2]\)</span> then the graph of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is the upper bounding curve.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Based on the sketch, we find that there is some number <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> on the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis for which the upper bounding curve is <span class="math inline">\(h(x) = x+ 1\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(x\in [0, x_0]\)</span> and the upper bounding curve is <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = 3 - x^2\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(x\in [x_0, 2]\)</span>. Thus, the upper bounding curve has “changed” at <span class="math inline">\(x = x_0\)</span>. Our basic strategy for computing the area <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> of the region under consideration is to</p>
<ul>
<li>apply Theorem <a href="#thm:area">1</a> over the interval <span class="math inline">\([0, x_0]\)</span> with upper function <span class="math inline">\(h(x)\)</span> and lower function <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span>,</li>
<li>apply Theorem <a href="#thm:area">1</a> over the interval <span class="math inline">\([x_0, 2]\)</span> with upper function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> and lower function <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span>,</li>
<li>add the results of the previous two steps.</li>
</ul>
<p>In symbols, this strategy is to compute
<span class="math display" id="eq:strategy">\[\begin{equation}
    A 
    = \int_0^{x_0}(h(x) - g(x))\; \mathrm d x
    + \int_{x_0}^2(f(x) - g(x))\; \mathrm d x. 
\tag{1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>At this moment, the only barrier between our current standing and being able to apply this strategy is that we do not know the value of <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>. However, observing that <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-coordinate of the intersection of the curves <span class="math inline">\(y = x + 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y = 3- x^2\)</span>, we easily overcome this barrier by computing as follows:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
    3 - x^2 = x + 1
    &amp; \Leftrightarrow 0 = x^2 + x - 2\\
    &amp; \Leftrightarrow 0 = (x - 1)(x + 2)\\
    &amp; \Leftrightarrow x \in \{1, -2\}.
\end{split}
\end{equation*}\]</span>
Evidently <span class="math inline">\(x_0 = 1\)</span> is the value we seek.</p>
Finally, we execute our strategy by applying equation <a href="#eq:strategy">(1)</a> with <span class="math inline">\(x_0 = 1\)</span> and the given expressions for <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> and then performing routine computations as follows:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
    A 
    &amp; = \int_0^{1}(x + 1 - (x^2 - 5))\; \mathrm d x
    + \int_{1}^2(3 - x^2 - (x^2 - 5))\; \mathrm d x\\
    &amp; = \int_0^1(-x^2 + x + 6)\; \mathrm d x
    + \int_1^2(-2x^2+8)\; \mathrm d x\\
    &amp; = \left(-\frac{x^3}{3} + \frac{x^2}{2} + 6\right)\bigg|_0^1
    + \left(-\frac{2x^3}{3} + 8x \right)\bigg|_1^2\\
    &amp; = \frac{19}{2}.
