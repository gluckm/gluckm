<p>Inversion through the unit sphere is the map <span class="math inline">\(\varphi: \mathbb R^n\setminus\{0\}\to \mathbb R^n\)</span> defined by
<span class="math display" id="eq:inversionmap">\[\begin{equation}
    \varphi(x) = \frac x{|x|^2},
    \tag{1}
\end{equation}\]</span>
where here and throughout the post, I assume that <span class="math inline">\(n\geq 2\)</span>. The need to compute the Jacobian determinant of this map arises frequently enough in my line of
research that a discussion of it’s computation is warranted. Let me start by stating the
result that I will prove.</p>
<div class="lemma">
<p><span id="lem:unlabeled-div-1" class="lemma"><strong>Lemma 1  </strong></span>The determinant of the derivative of the map in <a href="#eq:inversionmap">(1)</a> at <span class="math inline">\(x\in \mathbb R^n\setminus\{0\}\)</span> is
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
    \det(D\varphi(x)) = -|x|^{-2n}.
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>The lemma is established via direct computation. However suitability of the adjective <em>direct</em>
is up for debate. This is because the first computation that one would naively use
to prove the lemma is not pleasant. The computation that I will present is well-known and<br />
computationally convenient but it requires a bit more thought than the method one may
try as a first approach.</p>
<div id="a-natural-first-approach" class="section level1">
<h1>A natural first approach</h1>
<p>The most immediate method one may try to compute the Jacobian of <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> is to first compute
all partials of all coordinate maps of <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span>, organize said partial derivatives into a matrix,
then compute the determinant of the resulting matrix. Following this strategy, I will denote
the <span class="math inline">\(i^{\text{th}}\)</span> coordinate function of <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_i\)</span> so that
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
    \varphi_i(x) = \frac{x_i}{|x|^2} \qquad i = 1, \ldots, n.
\end{equation*}\]</span>
With this notation, the partial derivatives of the <span class="math inline">\(i^{\text{th}}\)</span> coordinate function are
<span class="math display" id="eq:partials">\[\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial \varphi_i}{\partial x_j}(x)
    = \frac 1{|x|^4}\left(|x|^2 \delta_{ij} - 2x_ix_j\right)
    \qquad \text{ for } i, j = 1, \ldots, n,  
    \tag{2}
\end{equation}\]</span>
and hence the matrix <span class="math inline">\(D\varphi(x) = \left(\frac{\partial\varphi_i}{\partial x_j}\right)_{ij}\)</span>
is<br />
<span class="math display" id="eq:derivmatrix">\[\begin{equation}
    D\varphi(x)
    = |x|^{-4}\begin{bmatrix}
    |x|^2 - 2x_1^2 &amp; -2x_1x_2 &amp; \ldots &amp; -2x_1x_n\\
    -2x_1x_2 &amp; |x|^2 - 2x_2^2 &amp; \ldots &amp; -2x_2x_n\\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp;  \vdots \\
    -2x_1x_n&amp; -2x_2x_n &amp; \ldots &amp; |x|^2 - 2x_n^2
    \end{bmatrix}.
    \tag{3}
\end{equation}\]</span>
To compute the determinant of <span class="math inline">\(D\varphi(x)\)</span> one may expand the determinant along the
row or column of their choosing.</p>
<p>The above-described strategy is reasonable in low
dimensions, say <span class="math inline">\(n = 2\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(n = 3\)</span> but no one would want to do this for any higher
dimension. Even if someone were sufficiently determined and sufficiently careful enough
to carry out this computation for some <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 4\)</span>,
they would still lack a formula for <span class="math inline">\(\det D\varphi\)</span> that holds for general <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.
To obtain such a formula one may consider attempting an inductive
proof (inducting on <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>), but the tedium in this strategy quickly makes itself
apparent.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-more-reasonable-approach" class="section level1">
<h1>A more reasonable approach</h1>
<p>As previously mentioned, the following computation requires a bit more thought
than the method outlined in the previous section but it is far more approachable
from a computational point of view. In particular, it avoids cofactor expansion-based
computation of the determinant.</p>
<p>The first observation to make is that <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\circ \varphi = I\)</span>
on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb R^n\setminus\{0\}\)</span>, so the chain rule gives
<span class="math display" id="eq:chainrule">\[\begin{equation}
    I = D\varphi(\varphi(x))D\varphi(x)
    \qquad \text{ for all }x\in \mathbb R^n\setminus\{0\}.
    \tag{4}
\end{equation}\]</span>
From <a href="#eq:partials">(2)</a> one may write <span class="math inline">\(D\varphi\)</span> in the following basis-independent and more
streamlined notation (more streamlined compared to the matrix notation used in <a href="#eq:derivmatrix">(3)</a>):
<span class="math display" id="eq:dvarphi">\[\begin{equation}
    D\varphi(x) = |x|^{-2}\left(I - 2\frac{x}{|x|}\otimes \frac{x}{|x|}\right),  
    \tag{5}
\end{equation}\]</span><br />
where <span class="math inline">\(x\otimes y\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> matrix whose <span class="math inline">\((i,j)\)</span> entry is <span class="math inline">\(x_iy_j\)</span>. Evaluation of
equation <a href="#eq:dvarphi">(5)</a> at <span class="math inline">\(\varphi(x)\)</span> gives
<span class="math display" id="eq:dvarphivarphi">\[\begin{equation}
    D\varphi(\varphi(x)) = |x|^2\left(I - 2\frac{x}{|x|}\otimes \frac{x}{|x|}\right).
    \tag{6}
\end{equation}\]</span><br />
Using equations <a href="#eq:dvarphi">(5)</a> and <a href="#eq:dvarphivarphi">(6)</a> in equation <a href="#eq:chainrule">(4)</a>,
then taking the determinant of both sides of the resultant equality gives
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
    1
    &amp; = \det(I)
    = \left(\det\left(I - 2\frac{x}{|x|}\otimes \frac{x}{|x|}\right)\right)^2
\end{split}
\end{equation*}\]</span>
for all <span class="math inline">\(x\in \mathbb R^n\setminus\{0\}\)</span>. Therefore, the range of the map
<span class="math display" id="eq:detmap">\[\begin{equation}
    x\mapsto \det\left(I - 2\frac{x}{|x|}\otimes \frac{x}{|x|}\right)
    \tag{7}
\end{equation}\]</span>
contained in <span class="math inline">\(\{\pm 1\}\)</span>. However, the continuity of the map in <a href="#eq:detmap">(7)</a> together
with the fact that the domain of this map <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb R^n\setminus\{0\}\)</span> is connected
guarantees that the range is either <span class="math inline">\(\{1\}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\{-1\}\)</span>. That is, the map in
<a href="#eq:detmap">(7)</a> is constant and it’s sole value is either <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>. Choosing
<span class="math inline">\(x = e_1\)</span>, the first standard basis vector, one finds that
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
    I - 2e_1\otimes e_1
    = \begin{bmatrix}
    -1 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0\\
    0 &amp; 1 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0\\
    \vdots &amp;\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp;\vdots\\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; 1
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}\]</span>
and hence <span class="math inline">\(\det(I - 2e_1\otimes e_1) = -1\)</span>. This allows one to deduce that
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
    \det\left(1 - 2\frac x{|x|}\otimes \frac x{|x|}\right)
    = -1
    \qquad \text{ for all }x\in \mathbb R^n\setminus\{0\}.
\end{equation*}\]</span>
Finally, returning to <a href="#eq:dvarphi">(5)</a> gives
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
    \det(D\varphi(x)) =
    \det\left(|x|^{-2}\left(I - 2\frac{x}{|x|}\otimes \frac{x}{|x|}\right)\right)
    = -|x|^{-2n}
\end{equation*}\]</span>
as asserted.</p>
