abstract: In this work we consider the Euler-Lagrange equation for the the critical points of a functional related to the conformal exponent case of the classical Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality. By lifting the problem to the sphere and leveraging the symmetries of the lifted problem, the existence of an unbounded sequence of sign-changing solutions is established. As a consequence, the existence of an unbounded sequence of sign-changing solutions to a nonlinear system of equations involving the fractional Laplacian is obtained.
