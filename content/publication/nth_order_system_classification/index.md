abstract: This work concerns the distributional solutions of a conformally invariant system of $n^{\text {th}}$-order elliptic equations on $\mathbb R^n$ having exponential type nonlinearity. The system in question is a natural generalization of the constant $Q$-curvature equation on $\mathbb R^n$. Under an $L^1$-finiteness assumption and some assumptions on the coupoing coefficients, an asymptotic estimat for solutions as $|x|\to\infty$ is obtained. Under a growth constraing and further $L^1$-norm assumptions, the method of moving spheres is used to show that, up to an additive polynomial of low degree, each of the unknown functions is a standard bubble wiht common center and scale parameters.
